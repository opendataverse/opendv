# OpenDV

Open Dataverse (opendv) focuses on standardizing data publishing and delivery practices with the rigor of a “Data as a Product” mindset to improve the overall data user experience.

## Principles of OpenDV
- Data Products are registered (metadata, schema, schedule, quality standards etc) and validated when actual data arrives.
- Published data is delivered (cross fed) in multiple formats (Batch Files, Streams, API)
- **Event driven:** Data producers and consumers are decoupled and only depend on published events about the data
- **Trust:** Builds **trust** in the data by profiling, collecting & publishing metrics about the data, Utilization & its availability there off
- **Self service:**  Access to data secured by policy driven security frameworks (IAM etc) owned by Data Producers/ Stewards
